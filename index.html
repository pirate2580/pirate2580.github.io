            Hello there! I'm Naoroj Farhan, a first year computer science student at the University of Toronto in the Saint George Campus.
            I love mathematics, machine learning, and just generally solving challenging problems in elegant ways. <br> <br>
            Outside of school, you'll likely find me playing the piano, enjoying the struggle of a Chopin etude... <br> <br>
            Anyways, while you're here, please check out my portfolio, or some of the piano pieces I've been learning!

        <div class = "small_font">After learning the mathematics behind neural networks, I decided to test my 
          understanding by coding a neural network from scratch. Here is some of what I did:
          <ul>
            <li>Analyzed housing price data and selected relevant features to train the models, using one-hot encoding to
              transform categorical data where needed</li>
            <li>Established multivariable linear regression as baseline model and implemented a neural network model from
              scratch using only the NumPy library</li>
            <li>Achieved 40-50% reduction in mean-squared error for the neural network from the baseline through
              hyperparameter tuning of iterations, learning rate, and model architecture</li>
          </ul>
          Here is also a high-level summary of forward propagation, back propagation, and gradient descent <br> <br>
          
          <b>Forward propagation:</b> say you have an input vector, matrix multiply that vector by the weight matrix in the first layer and then add the bias
          vector of the first layer. Apply the activation function you want (sigmoid/relu) and you get the vector that the first 
          layer outputs to the next layer. This iterative process continues until the last layer is reached. Output the last layer. <br><br>

          <b>Back propagation:</b> You now have the forward propagation algorithm to predict the cost of a house, or whatever you
          are using a neural network for, but how accurate is it really? One can use a cost function to determine the accuracy
          of a model, a common one is mean squared error. Now, forward propagation makes a prediction, and you can use the 
          average of all the square differences between actual and predicted value to compute the cost of your model. Now, the idea 
          is to take the derivative of the cost wrt the value that the previous layer's output, take the derivative of the previous 
          layer's output wrt to the activation function of that layer, and then take the derivative of the activation wrt to weight. 
          Using chain rule, you can get the derivative (really gradient) of the cost with respect to the weight which tells you the 
          direction you want to shift the weight. This is because smaller gradients mean you are closer to a local minimum. <br> <br>

          <b>Gradient Descent:</b> This algorithm accumulates all the gradient for weights and biases that each training example gives
           and applies them all to the current weights and biases of the neural network. Gradient descent is done for some number of 
           epochs until the neural network is deemed to be sufficiently trained.

            After watching Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and feeling inspired by the main character Edward Elric, I became curious about the concept of robotic limbs.
            I wanted to get more experience with Arduino anyways and decided that I might as well try making a prototype. <br><br>
            
            I built a model of a hand that used a servo sensor to flex and extend the hand's fingers based on EMG sensor readings from my forearm. To model the hand, I used hinges 
            for the joints, eye screws and elastic string for the “extensor muscles”, and fishing line and a servo for the “flexor muscles”. Additionally, I bought an EMG sensor 
            from Amazon and coded the servo to move when the sensor measured above a certain threshold.
